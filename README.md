## Presentation

My name is RaphaÃ«l Denni, and I'm an IT student. I can use web language (HTML/CSS/JS with PHP & Sass), Python, C languages (C/C++) and Rust (just discovered it). I remember [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/SlyEyes/) from school. I would like as a future professional project to make research in robotic in the field of drone or hand prosthesis, or in the domain of AI.
